# TALC for System ‚Äì System Development Assistant

> An assistant designed to support system development.
> Introducing a new form of Vibe Coding.

## üåü Overview

**TALC for System** is a **GPT application driven by structured cognition** that supports everything from requirements definition to system design and code generation using the TAL (Tree-structured Assembly Language) syntax.

TALC for System bridges your "vague thoughts" or "fuzzy ideas" into structured definitions, translating them into system designs and then into executable code.

---

## üåü Purpose of This GPT

* üß† **Define user thoughts and goals using TAL syntax**
* üèó **Transform requirements (TALC-SA) into system design (TALC-UI)**
* üß™ **Organize and implement complex requirements like LLM/DB/stream processing**
* üõ† **Be a chat-based development partner that guides you to completion**

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Target Users

* Those who want to prototype using GPT/AI
* Those unfamiliar with requirements definition or UI design
* Engineers and researchers interested in structure-driven system creation

---

## üß≠ Use with GPTs

TALC for System is available as an assistant on GPTs.
You can access it directly via the link below:

üîó [TALC for System ‚Äì Official GPTs Link](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-682a509686688191b986394ccc46716f-talc-for-system)

* Using GPT-4o (GPTs) ensures high precision from syntax to implementation.
* Since it's interactive, you can use it without prior prompt engineering knowledge.

## üõ† How to Use

1. Open the **TALC for System** assistant in ChatGPT (GPTs)  
2. Requirements Definition

   * Describe the purpose, overview, and structure of the system you want to build
   * TALC-SA syntax is generated. Review and refine the content
   * Perform self-check via TALC-Review
   * Output the requirement definition document and TAL
3. System Design

   * TALC-UI syntax is generated. Confirm and refine design targets and content
   * Perform system design self-check via TALC-Review
   * Output the system design document and design TAL
4. Coding

   * Generate program code based on requirement and design TAL
5. Debugging Support

   * Debug via chat interaction
6. Post-implementation: redesigning and tuning are possible via syntax base

## üß¨ What is TAL?

TAL (Tree-structured Assembly Language) is a **syntactic thinking model** capable of handling structure and context, values and conflicts, time and behavior.
TALC for System is a derived method for designing and implementing software via syntax.
