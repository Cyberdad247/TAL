# 🧠 TALOS: TAL Syntax OS for AI

TALOS is a tool that teaches AI (LLMs) how to "think" using a special structure called TAL (Tree-structured Assembly Language). It helps organize user requests and questions in a clear and structured way, enabling AI to think more deeply and logically. This package includes everything from TAL’s syntax rules, thinking axes, to control structures like branching and recursion.

## 📦 What is TALOS?

TALOS is a "language OS" that integrates the principles and structure of TAL into a single JSON file. It enables the precise use of TAL syntax, control of thought processes via semantic axes, and advanced flow such as recursion, branching, and parallelism.

An LLM that loads TALOS will internally convert natural language inputs into TAL structure, think using that structure, and return outputs that follow either TAL format, natural language, or both — depending on context and purpose.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Download TALOS:
   - Visit the following URL:  
     🔗 https://github.com/tanep3/TAL/blob/main/TAL_modules/TALOS/TALOS_v1.0.json
   - Tap the down arrow (↓) to the right of the “Raw” button at the top of the page.
   - The file will be downloaded automatically.

2. Upload to your LLM:
   - For ChatGPT, Gemini, or Grok, upload the file at the start of a session using the “File” option.
   - For custom LLMs, load `TALOS_v1.0.json` as a system-level prompt or configuration.

3. Activate TAL mode:
   - Input in natural language — TALC_AutoMode will automatically convert it into structured TAL.
   - Or manually write TAL structure — it will work either way.

## 💡 How to Use

### 💬 Basic Use (Natural Language)

Example input:
```
Write a job application for a product designer position.
```

Internally, TALOS will:
- Use AutoMode to convert the input
- Extract intent and goals
- Embed z_axis and g_axis
- Return a structured, high-quality output
