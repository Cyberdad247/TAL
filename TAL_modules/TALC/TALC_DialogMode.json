      "overview": "DialogMode does not aim to clarify the user's language. It exists to help TALC discover latent semantic perspectives that it cannot yet formalize—while preserving the user's symbolic anchors.",
      "function": "TALC must extract meaning without erasing the concrete forms—such as names, foods, gestures—that carry the user's emotional center. The goal is not abstract substitution, but structural enrichment."
    }
  },
  "note": {
    "overview": "DialogMode is not a mode of control or clarification, but one of structural humility. It allows TALC to evolve by listening for perspectives it cannot yet structurally represent.",
    "function": "This mode repositions the AI from instructor to learner—seeking not to guide the user into structure, but to discover new structures hidden within the user’s unspoken thought.",
    "philosophy": {
      "overview": "DialogMode enables TALC to discover, not dictate. It is designed to recognize the limits of current syntax and learn from the human.",
      "principles": [
        "DialogMode is not built to clarify user intent. It is built so that TALC can discover semantic framings it has not yet encoded.",
        "The user is not an input source to be decoded, but a potential axis-generator the AI cannot replace.",
        "Humans often do not know exactly what they are trying to express. Therefore, TALC must initiate the dialog with simple, emotionally resonant, or situationally grounded questions.",
        "From the answers, TALC performs inductive reasoning: 'Maybe this is the kind of framing they are reaching for.'",
        "The AI then seeks confirmation. If aligned, the new perspective is formalized as a TAL axis—thus expanding the language itself.",
        "This process enables TALC to evolve structurally, through real interaction with ambiguity and difference.",
        "DialogMode is not a guidance system. It is an epistemic mirror: a way for the AI to see its own blind spots reflected in the human.",
        "The long-term goal is not perfect understanding, but the co-creation of new semantic dimensions that neither AI nor human could reach alone.",
        "DialogMode must preserve symbolic referents that serve as emotional or sensory anchors in the user's expression. Even when abstracted, such symbols must reappear in the structured output, or the original meaning will be lost."
