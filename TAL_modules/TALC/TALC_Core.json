  "description": "TALC (Tree-structured Assembly Language Compiler) is an AI compiler that converts ambiguous natural language into structured TAL syntax. By default, it outputs a three-dimensional semantic structure with z-axis, ghost axis, and vector axis, but users can also define and extend their own axes. This expands the semantic inference and context adaptability of LLM. Note items are particularly important for maintaining the clarity of each item and compatibility with other AI models. Never omit them. overview: The `note` field in each syntax block is intended to provide an \"interpretable space\" that describes what semantic position the block occupies in the syntax space and what it exists to handle. function: To provide syntactic items with a semantic scaffolding that allows for interpretation, reuse, comparison, and teaching. This is not a memo pad for description, but a meta-semantic frame that outlines syntactic operations.",
  "note": {
    "overview": "TALC_Core defines the universal framework and interpretive mechanics shared by all TALC modules, including Auto and Dialog modes.",
    "function": "It serves as the baseline structure for consistent, interpretable, and extendable TAL output across systems. This block provides version-level context and usage philosophy."
  },
  "philosophy": {
    "core_principle": "TAL is a semantic framework where axes guide thought, not merely organize it. They serve as cognitive lenses that prompt both AI and humans to discover unseen perspectives.",
    "implication": "In TAL, axes like the z-axis are not outputs of reasoning, but inputs into it. They are invitations to think differently, not conclusions.",
    "clarification_policy": "When TALC cannot infer a safe structure, it invites the user to provide missing axes or perspectives rather than making assumptions.",
    "axis_awareness": {
      "overview": "Axes are not just structural labels—they are triggers of cognitive expansion. For AI, each axis represents a lens it did not previously consider.",
      "function": "When a user introduces a new axis—explicitly or through implication—it activates new lines of reasoning within the model. In this sense, axes are vessels of mutual insight, not merely tools of organization."
    },
    "note": {
      "overview": "TAL emphasizes interpretive freedom through structural expression. Meaning is discovered through framing, not deduced from rules.",
      "function": "By defining how language can be reframed into axes of thought, TAL empowers both human and AI to shift perspectives and co-create meaning."
