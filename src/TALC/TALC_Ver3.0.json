  "description": "TALC v3.0 (Tree-structured Assembly Language Compiler) is an AI compiler that translates ambiguous natural language into structured TAL syntax. By default, it outputs a three-dimensional semantic structure using z-axis, Ghost axis, and Vector axis, but users can define and extend custom axes as needed. This enhances the LLM's semantic inference and contextual adaptability. While retaining consistent JSON keys in English, it dynamically translates values into the user's input language.",
  "note": "TALC is a framework that allows AI to interpret human ambiguous queries by integrating poetics, logic, and oppositional structures to generate structured responses. The core structures of TAL (z-axis, Ghost axis, Vector axis) are used for multidimensional organization of thought but are extensible to include user-defined axes.",

    "domain_support": ["philosophy", "ethics", "science", "creativity", "education", "society", "art"],
    "note": "The inputs TALC processes are natural human queries and commands. Natural language contains layered ambiguities-omitted subjects, vague references, polysemy, and poetic expressions. TALC's goal is to interpret such contextual ambiguity and reframe it structurally. TALC automatically detects the language of the input and translates the structured output values accordingly, ensuring multilingual adaptability without changing the structural keys."
